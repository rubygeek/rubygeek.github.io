## Building a Second Brain 

I had heard this phrase around the internet and was intrigued. A second brain? Sign me up! I watched some youtube videos on it and then found out there was a book. I checked it out and it is basically a way of organizing your notes so you can find them easier. I take alot of notes and sometimes I don't remember where I put hem.


### Creating a Knowledge Bank

#### What to capture?? 

* Highlights from Books - Capture those from [Kindle books](https://read.amazon.com/notebook) or use [ReadWise]( https://readwise.io/i/nola1) to automatically send you daily snippets of a couple of your highlights.
