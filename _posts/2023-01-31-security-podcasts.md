## Audio Podcasts

- [Sans Internet Storm Center](https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail.html) - I listen to this every night, it is short and a great summary of what is going on in
- [Daniel Miessler, Unsupervised Learning](https://danielmiessler.com/podcast/) - A great podcast with different viewpoints, including "human news" (also a great newsletter too)
- [Cyberwire Daily](https://thecyberwire.com/podcasts/daily-podcast) - Great summary of what is going on in security and news
- [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) - very interesting stories and sometimes bone chilling truths about the adversary. Go back and listen to the archives!
- [Paul's Security Weekly](https://www.scmagazine.com/podcast-show/pauls-security-weekly) - Sometimes they get off on tangents but it is always interesting to hear what these guys are talking about.
- [Beers with Talos](https://talosintelligence.com/podcasts/shows/beers_with_talos) - I found them during the pandemic, when they would do their "extra" episode and talk about non security things, pretty entertaining. I miss some of the personalities that have since left, but still a good source of information.
- [Out of the Woods, The Threat Hunting Podcast](https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/resources/podcast/) - Recently found this one, good information and I always joke about becoming a _Threat Hunter_ when i grow up!
- [Malicioius Life, by Cybereason](https://malicious.life/) - stories, like Darknet Diaries.
- [Critical Thinking - BugHunting](https://open.spotify.com/show/4GiJnv8f4a4ZR6Jc6TQJ3k) - just started by Justin Gardner (Rhynorater) & Joel Margolis (teknogeek)
