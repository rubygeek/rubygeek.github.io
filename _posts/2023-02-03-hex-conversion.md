Usually if I don't feel like converting a hexadecimal number by hand, I fire up some online calculator. But I learned this while watching [Packet Tuesdays with Dr. Johannes Ullrich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0lO874DwNM&list=PLs4eo9Tja8biVteSW4a3GHY8qi0t1lFLL&index=3).

Fire up the python REPL:

```python
int('1000', base=16)
4096
```

Its the simple things that get you! And I code for living! :) Thanks Dr. Johannes Ullrich
