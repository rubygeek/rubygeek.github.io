I recently watched the Seinfield eposide where they pitch their show to some procducers, "A Show about Nothing". I had heard about this term boefore but didn't really know what it meant.

I used to blog alot about ruby, clojure, a little javascript and some time mangement things I used to do. For some reason I stopped, but I want to start again.

In the past few years I reached my limit of using programming to amuse myself and got interested in Cybersecurity. I attended some Sans classe and was hooked. I continued untill I had 6 sans cetifications under my belt and a Gradute Certificate in [Cybersecurity Engineering](https://www.sans.edu/cyber-security-programs/graduate-certificate-engineering-core/). I may do more but content to now use some of what I have learned.

I plan to write about a few things I am interested in. Mostly to keep myself accountable to keep learning even when I am not pursuing a certain cerificate.

I also am learning guitar and work out at the YMCA and my home gym.
